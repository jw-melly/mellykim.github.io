        <div class="textbox1">An unusual taste or a style that might seem strange to others. 
            It could stem from a deep passion and love for something—or, conversely, from a 
            sense of profound lack or longing. In a way, everyone is somewhat fanatical about
             certain aspects of life. It’s a concept too ambiguous to define as purely good or bad.</div>
        <div class="textbox2">To some, it might appear eccentric or even insane. But from where I stand, that very thing,
             grounded in reality yet shining brilliantly in my world, is more radiant than 
             anything else.</div>
